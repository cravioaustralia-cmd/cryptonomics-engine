- Scaffolded reusable renderer at `shorts/shared/render/`.
- Rebuilding `s01-skylab-esperance` without Remotion CLI / `src/episodes` compositions.

## 2026-09-25 — s01 non-Remotion render complete
- Renderer: shorts/shared/render (SVG + renderFrame + Playwright + ffmpeg)

## 2026-09-25 — s02 man who named Australia (non-Remotion)
- Episode: `shorts/s02-man-who-named-australia/`
- VO: held file `incoming-vo/02-man-who-named-australia.mp3` (~64.968s) — not re-recorded
- Renderer: shorts/shared/render (SVG + renderFrame + Playwright + ffmpeg)
- Output: `shorts/s02-man-who-named-australia/out/s02-man-who-named-australia.mp4` → `deliverables/s02-man-who-named-australia/`

- Mix: VO + ducked music + timed SFX (shared + thematic), loudnorm on VO
- Licence note: image SOURCES.md is best-effort from pack; prefer cartoon motion over stills

## 2026-09-25 — s02 animation-primary rebuild (review fail fix)
- Prior cut FAILED review: photo slideshow + rudimentary SVG overlays; alpine mountain still used for Donington/Lincolnshire home village.
- Rewrote `shorts/s02-man-who-named-australia/render/scenes.js` to **ANIMATE-primary / STILL-as-card-only**.
- Deleted `images/s02_10_donington_st_mary.jpg` (alpine/Dolomite — geographically wrong). Village beat is pure English parish illustration.
- No full-bleed photo underlays (Euston, Mauritius coast, dig, portrait removed as backgrounds).
- Credibility cards only (brief): Flinders portrait, HMS Investigator, dig-site inset.
- Animated scenes: hook cemetery+station gulp, circumnavigate ship+Flinders, Trim deck friendship, prison bars+Mauritius island+Trim fade, AUSTRALIA slam+book, candle extinguish, London skyline grow+station gulp, dig particles+lead plate, English village rest+loop punchline.
- Re-rendered via `node shorts/shared/render/render-episode.mjs shorts/s02-man-who-named-australia`.
- Output: `out/s02-man-who-named-australia.mp4` (1080×1920 30fps ~64.9s) → `deliverables/s02-man-who-named-australia/`.
- Audio: held VO + Vastness + same SFX cues (re-mixed, not redesigned). No YouTube upload.

## 2026-09-25 — s02 MG rebuild (VO-echo killed)
- User rejected prior cut: VO-echo titles + weak design.
- Rewrote `s02…/render/scenes.js`: kill-list applied; short labels only; motion-graphics upgrades (wake/orbit, Trim blink, bars slam, ink stamp, page flip, candle smoke, skyline build, dig particles, plate rotate-in, cloud drift, crossfades).
- Updated MASTER_PROMPT.md, workflows/shorts-pipeline/SKILL.md, shorts/CLAUDE.md with on-screen text rule + MG quality bar.
- Re-rendered via `node shorts/shared/render/render-episode.mjs shorts/s02-man-who-named-australia`.
- Deliverable: `out/s02-man-who-named-australia.mp4` → `deliverables/s02-man-who-named-australia/`.

## 2026-09-25 — s02 premium rebuild (Issue #6)
- Claude Code redesigned `s02-man-who-named-australia/render/scenes.js` end to end: photo underlay on every beat + premium MG (see episode LOG/plan).
- Shared renderer: fonts, parallel capture, contact-sheet script, `--reuse-mix`, opt-in crossfade/caption styling (s01 defaults unchanged).
